KidzCoding Hour of Code - Apple Clicker

Activity: 
Today we are creating a game in which you are trying to click as many apples as you can
Learning Objectives: 
Learn how to use random position function
Learn how to use wait function 
Learn how to create clones and manipulate them
Materials: 
Finished project: 
Starter project: 
Coding Time!

Step one: Create “Score” variable and beginning the cloning  process 

Delete the main sprite and add the apple sprite. Make sure to select it because you are coding this sprite
then create a variable and call it score
Next, make it so that the score is set to zero after the program is run
Then create a loop that creates a clone every second (or whatever time period you choose)

Step two: add “when I start as a clone” block and randomizing clone position

Add when I start as clone block 
Next make it so that the clone goes to a random position
Make it so that after a few seconds, the clone is deleted 

Step three: add clicking feature

Add “when this sprite is clicked” block
Make it so that when the sprite is clicked the score is changed by one and the clone is deleted


Congratulations, you have just completed an Hour of Code!

Feel free to mess around with the code to make it suitable for your intentions
