Activity: 
This activity is a simple wardrobe game in Scratch that uses loops, conditionals, and user input. This game will allow the player to change the size and color of their sprite. 
Learning Objectives: 
Learn how to change color 
Learn how to change size
Learn how to assign actions to keybinds
Learn how to duplicate code for efficiency

Starter project: default scratch project
Coding Time!

Step one: Choosing a sprite and laying the foundation of your code
First, delete the default sprite and choose a sprite of your choice
Then, add “when started” block and a forever loop

Step two: adding the if-then statement and duplicating 
First, add an if statement to the inside of the forever loop
Add the “key pressed” block to the if then statement
Then, duplicate the if statement three times so you have four of them in total

Step three: creating the first two keyboard functions
First, set the first key pressed statement to up arrow
Then set the second one to down arrow
In the if statement of the first add the change size block
Add another change size block to the second if statement. But for this one, make it -10
Now you can make your sprite larger and smaller

Step four: creating the last two keyboard functions
First, set the third key pressed statement to the right arrow and the fourth one to the left arrow
Next, add the “change color effect” statement to the third if statement
Then, add the “set size” function to the fourth if statement
Now you can reset the size of your sprite and change its color

Congratulations, you have just completed an Hour of Code!

Feel free to mess around with the code to make it suitable for your intentions
