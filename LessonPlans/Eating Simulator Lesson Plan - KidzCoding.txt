Coding Time!

Step one: The creating variable and sprites

Choose whichever sprite you want to eat the food
Pick out any food you want from scratch’s provided sprites
Create a variable called “points”
Step two: Cloning
With the food sprite selected, add a “when started” block and right below that make it so that the “points” variable is set to zero
Make it so that the food sprite upon the start of the program hides itself
In a forever loop, make it so that the sprite waits for a fraction of a second before creating  a clone of itself
Step three: designing the clones
Firstly, begin by adding the “when I start as a clone” block
Then, make the clone show itself and go to a random location
Next, in a forever loop, make it so that if the food is touching the food consumer sprite, change the variable “points” by one and hide
Step four: designing the consumer
Firstly, begin by adding the when started block
Below the when started block, add a forever loop, and inside the forever loop add a “go to mouse cursor” block


Step five: Adding effects
By default, the sprites in scratch are pretty big, which makes this game too easy for the average user. To change this, you can use the “set size” and “change size” blocks. 
To do this, you can select the consumer sprite and add a “change size” block
I recommend you make it at least twice as small as it is normally
You can do the same thing to the food sprite so its harder to pick up
Then, if you want to get even more fancy you can make it so that the consumer sprite gains a percentage of mass with each food consumed

Congratulations, you have just completed an Hour of Code!
