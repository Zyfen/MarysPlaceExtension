Kids Code Hour of Code - addition calculator 
Activity: 
In this activity, students will design a quiz in which a math question is given. If the player answers correctly, a point will be awarded. However, if the answer is incorrect, two points will be deducted. Students will use variables, randomization, and loops.

Learning Objectives: 
Students will learn how addition can be applied to their code
Students will learn how to use RNG
Students will be able to use variables
Students will be able to add user input using scratch
Materials: 
Finished project: 
Starter project 


Coding Time!

Step 1: establishing the start of your code 

Create four variables:
Number one
Number two
guess
Points
Add a “when clicked” block 
Right below the “when clicked” block, set the variable “points” to 0
Step 2: Creating Random Numbers and Getting User’s Guess 

Set the variables “number one” and “number two” to both pick a random number between 1 and 10
Add in the “answer” block in the sensing tab
**this block is equal to what the user typed in
Set the variable “guess” equal to answer
This assigns the user input to the variable “guess”
Step 3: adding “ask” and “if-else” functions

Add the “ask” function in the sensing tab and make it so that it asks the user what the sum of the two numbers are 
Next, create an if-else statement that will determine if the user’s input (the guess variable) is equal to the correct answer
If the guess is right, make sure that the text “correct” is printed. If the guess is wrong, make sure that the text “incorrect” is printed. 
Use the change variable function to change the values of the variables depending on if the guess was correct or incorrect



Step 4: The Forever Loop 

Add forever loop that encompasses all but the “set points to zero” function



Congratulations, you have just completed an Hour of Code!
